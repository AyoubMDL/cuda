## Learning summary

* Implemented Reduction Sum in CUDA:
Learned how to compute the sum of a large vector using parallel reduction in CUDA.

* Shared Memory Utilization and Tree-Based Reduction Pattern

* Final Sum Calculation:
Repeated block-level reductions until only one block remained, performing the final reduction to obtain the complete sum.
