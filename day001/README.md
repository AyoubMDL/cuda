## Learning summary

### GPU VS CPU
* CPU is optimized for reducing latency (faster response for single tasks)
* GPU is optimized for maximizing throughput (process many tasks in parallel)

### Learned
* Basics of writing a CUDA kernel.
* Cuda keywords (__global__, cudaMalloc, cudaMemcpy, cudaFree, threads, blocks) following mainly
intro to cuda from [Umar Jamil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zy8ChVd_oTM&t=10488s&ab_channel=UmarJamil).
* Coded simple vector addition
